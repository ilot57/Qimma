# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Result Page Layout [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a comprehensive layout for the student results interface that balances information density with usability
### Details:
Design the overall structure of the results page considering visual complexity principles. Include sections for summary statistics, question breakdown, and navigation elements. Ensure the interface reduces cognitive load by organizing information hierarchically.

## 2. Implement Question Grades Component [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Develop a component to display individual question grades with appropriate visual indicators
### Details:
Create a component that shows each question's grade, including score, maximum points, and visual indicators (color coding, progress bars) to represent performance. Include sorting and filtering capabilities to help users navigate through multiple questions.

## 3. Develop AI Feedback System [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2
### Description: Create a system for generating and displaying AI-powered feedback on student responses
### Details:
Implement backend logic to analyze student responses and generate constructive feedback. Design the frontend component to display this feedback in an easily digestible format, with options to expand/collapse detailed explanations.

## 4. Build Answer Viewer Component [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2
### Description: Create an interactive component for viewing student answers alongside correct solutions
### Details:
Develop a side-by-side viewer that displays the student's answer and the correct solution. Include syntax highlighting for code, math rendering for equations, and appropriate formatting for different question types. Implement highlighting to show discrepancies.

## 5. Implement Grade Adjustment Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2
### Description: Create tools for instructors to adjust grades with appropriate validation and history tracking
### Details:
Develop UI controls for grade modification with validation to ensure grades stay within allowed ranges. Implement backend logic to record changes, reasons for adjustment, and maintain an audit trail. Include confirmation dialogs for significant changes.

## 6. Create Feedback Editing System [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.3
### Description: Develop tools for instructors to edit and customize feedback provided to students
### Details:
Build a rich text editor for modifying AI-generated feedback or creating custom feedback. Include templates, formatting options, and the ability to insert media. Implement version control to track changes to feedback over time.

## 7. Implement Comments and Annotations System [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.4
### Description: Create functionality for adding comments and annotations to specific parts of student responses
### Details:
Develop a system for pinpointing specific sections of student work and attaching comments. Include text highlighting, margin notes, and drawing tools. Ensure comments can be categorized (e.g., critical issues, minor suggestions, positive feedback).

## 8. Build Grade Recalculation Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.5
### Description: Develop a system to automatically recalculate overall grades when individual question scores change
### Details:
Implement backend logic to handle grade recalculation based on weighting rules and grading policies. Create UI elements to show the impact of changes on the overall grade. Include validation to prevent unintended consequences of adjustments.

## 9. Implement Change History Tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.5, 15.6, 15.8
### Description: Create a comprehensive system for tracking and displaying the history of changes to grades and feedback
### Details:
Develop a database structure to record all modifications with timestamps and user information. Create a UI to display the change history in a chronological timeline. Include filtering options to focus on specific types of changes.

## 10. Develop Report Generation System [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2, 15.3, 15.8
### Description: Create functionality to generate comprehensive reports on student performance
### Details:
Implement backend logic to compile performance data across questions and assessments. Design report templates with customizable sections. Include options for exporting in various formats (PDF, CSV, etc.) and visualization tools for performance trends.
