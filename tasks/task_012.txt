# Task ID: 12
# Title: Background Job Processing System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a background job processing system using Vercel Cron Jobs for handling exam processing tasks asynchronously.
# Details:
1. Set up Vercel Cron Jobs for scheduled tasks
2. Create job queue table in database
3. Implement job creation, updating, and tracking
4. Create job processor for exam processing
5. Implement retry logic for failed jobs
6. Add job prioritization based on user tier
7. Create job status monitoring dashboard
8. Implement email notifications for job completion
9. Add error handling and reporting
10. Create job cancellation functionality
11. Implement job progress tracking
12. Add logging for debugging purposes

# Test Strategy:
Test job queue processing with various load scenarios, verify retry logic works for failed jobs, ensure email notifications are sent correctly, validate job prioritization works as expected, and test the system under high load conditions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up Vercel Cron configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create and configure the vercel.json file with appropriate cron job schedules
### Details:
Create a vercel.json file in the project root directory and define cron job configurations with appropriate paths and schedules. Use the '0 5 * * *' syntax for daily jobs at 5am UTC or customize as needed for your background processing requirements.

## 2. Implement API endpoint for cron job execution [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Create a serverless function that will be triggered by the Vercel cron job
### Details:
Develop a serverless or edge function at the path specified in your vercel.json (e.g., /api/cron) that will be called when the cron job executes. This function should initialize the job queue processing and handle authentication to ensure only Vercel can trigger it.

## 3. Design job queue data structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a database schema for storing job information and status
### Details:
Design a database schema to store job information including job type, status, priority, creation time, execution time, retry count, and related metadata. Consider using a NoSQL database for flexibility or a relational database for complex queries.

## 4. Implement job queue management system [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.3
### Description: Create functions to add, retrieve, and update jobs in the queue
### Details:
Develop functions to enqueue new jobs, dequeue jobs for processing, update job status, and manage job lifecycle. Implement prioritization logic to ensure high-priority jobs are processed first.

## 5. Build job processor with retry logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2, 12.4
### Description: Create a system to process jobs and handle failures with retry capability
### Details:
Implement a job processor that executes jobs from the queue, handles failures gracefully, and implements exponential backoff retry logic. Set maximum retry attempts and track retry counts for each job.

## 6. Implement comprehensive error handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.5
### Description: Create error handling mechanisms for different types of job failures
### Details:
Develop error handling strategies for different failure scenarios (temporary vs. permanent failures). Implement dead letter queues for jobs that consistently fail after maximum retries. Create detailed error logging with contextual information.

## 7. Develop job monitoring dashboard [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.4, 12.5
### Description: Create a UI for monitoring job status, history, and performance
### Details:
Build a dashboard UI that displays current job queue status, historical job execution data, success/failure rates, and performance metrics. Include filtering and search capabilities for job analysis.

## 8. Implement notification system [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.6
### Description: Create a system to send notifications for job status changes and failures
### Details:
Develop a notification system that can send alerts via email, Slack, or other channels when critical jobs fail or when system-wide issues are detected. Allow configuration of notification preferences based on job types and severity.

## 9. Create job cancellation and progress tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.4, 12.5
### Description: Implement functionality to cancel jobs and track progress of long-running jobs
### Details:
Build mechanisms to safely cancel jobs that are queued or in progress. Implement progress tracking for long-running jobs with percentage completion and estimated time remaining calculations.

## 10. Set up comprehensive logging system [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.5, 12.6, 12.8, 12.9
### Description: Implement detailed logging for all job processing activities
### Details:
Create a structured logging system that captures detailed information about job execution, including timing data, input parameters, output results, errors, and system state. Implement log rotation and retention policies for efficient storage.
