# Task ID: 18
# Title: File Storage and Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement secure file storage and management for exam documents using AWS S3 via Supabase Storage, including encryption, access control, and lifecycle management.
# Details:
1. Configure AWS S3 buckets via Supabase Storage
2. Implement server-side encryption for stored files
3. Create time-limited access URLs generation
4. Add file metadata tracking in database
5. Implement automatic cleanup of old files
6. Create backup strategy for important documents
7. Add file versioning for edited documents
8. Implement access control based on user permissions
9. Create file compression for large uploads
10. Add virus scanning for uploaded files
11. Implement file type validation
12. Create file retrieval API endpoints

# Test Strategy:
Test file upload and retrieval with various file types and sizes, verify encryption works correctly, ensure access URLs expire as expected, validate automatic cleanup removes only appropriate files, and test the system with concurrent uploads and downloads.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Configure S3 Buckets and Prefixes [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create and configure S3 buckets with appropriate naming conventions and prefixes to optimize performance and scalability.
### Details:
Set up multiple prefixes within buckets to enable parallel read/write operations and improve throughput. Ensure bucket names comply with AWS standards.

## 2. Implement Encryption for Stored Files [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Enable encryption for files stored in S3 to ensure data confidentiality at rest.
### Details:
Configure server-side encryption using AWS KMS-managed keys (SSE-KMS) or S3-managed keys (SSE-S3). Verify encryption is enforced on all uploads.

## 3. Set Up Access Control Policies [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Define and apply fine-grained access control policies to S3 buckets and objects.
### Details:
Use IAM roles and policies with least privilege principle. Implement resource-based policies restricting access by IP or VPC. Enable S3 Block Public Access to prevent public exposure.

## 4. Generate and Manage Access URLs [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.3
### Description: Create mechanisms to generate secure, time-limited access URLs for file retrieval.
### Details:
Implement generation of pre-signed URLs or CloudFront signed URLs to provide temporary, controlled access to files without exposing buckets publicly.

## 5. Track and Store File Metadata [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Design and implement metadata tracking for each stored file to support management and retrieval.
### Details:
Capture metadata such as upload timestamp, file size, encryption status, version ID, and access permissions. Store metadata in a database or metadata service linked to S3 objects.

## 6. Implement File Cleanup and Lifecycle Policies [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Set up automated cleanup and lifecycle management for files to optimize storage costs and compliance.
### Details:
Configure S3 lifecycle rules to transition files to cheaper storage classes or delete them after a retention period. Include manual cleanup processes for orphaned or invalid files.

## 7. Configure Backup and Versioning [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Enable versioning and backup strategies to protect against accidental deletion or corruption.
### Details:
Activate S3 versioning on buckets to keep multiple versions of objects. Implement backup policies and test restore procedures to ensure data durability.

## 8. Apply Compression to Files Before Upload [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate compression of files prior to upload to reduce storage size and improve transfer efficiency.
### Details:
Choose appropriate compression algorithms (e.g., gzip, zstd) based on file types. Ensure decompression is supported during retrieval.

## 9. Integrate Virus Scanning for Uploaded Files [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Implement virus scanning on files before or after upload to prevent malware storage.
### Details:
Use antivirus tools or services to scan files on upload. Block or quarantine infected files and notify administrators.

## 10. Develop Validation and Retrieval APIs [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.2, 18.3, 18.4, 18.5
### Description: Create APIs for validating file integrity and retrieving files securely from S3.
### Details:
Implement API endpoints to validate file metadata, check encryption and access permissions, and retrieve files using secure URLs. Include error handling and logging.
