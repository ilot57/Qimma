# Task ID: 20
# Title: Performance Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 11, 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize application performance to meet requirements for page load time, API response time, and concurrent user support.
# Details:
1. Implement code splitting for reduced bundle size
2. Add image optimization using Next.js Image component
3. Implement Redis caching for API responses
4. Create database query optimization
5. Add proper indexing for frequently queried fields
6. Implement lazy loading for components
7. Create virtualized lists for large data sets
8. Add prefetching for likely user paths
9. Implement debouncing for frequent user actions
10. Create skeleton loading states
11. Add performance monitoring with appropriate tools
12. Implement server-side rendering for critical pages

# Test Strategy:
Benchmark page load times before and after optimization, verify API response times meet requirements, test with simulated concurrent users, validate caching improves performance for repeated requests, and monitor memory usage during extended use.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Code Splitting [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Divide application code into smaller, logical chunks that can be loaded on demand to reduce initial load time and improve resource usage.
### Details:
Identify large modules and configure build tools (e.g., Webpack, Vite) for dynamic imports. Ensure critical paths are loaded first and test chunk loading in various user flows.

## 2. Optimize Images [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Compress and resize images to reduce file size and improve load times without sacrificing visual quality.
### Details:
Audit all image assets, convert to modern formats (e.g., WebP), automate compression in the build pipeline, and ensure responsive image delivery for different device sizes.

## 3. Configure Caching Strategies [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up effective caching for static and dynamic assets to minimize redundant network requests and speed up repeat visits.
### Details:
Implement HTTP cache headers, leverage service workers for offline support, and use a CDN for static assets. Validate cache invalidation logic for updates.

## 4. Optimize Database Queries [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze and refactor backend queries to minimize latency and reduce unnecessary data fetching.
### Details:
Profile slow queries, add query constraints, use pagination, and batch requests where possible. Ensure all endpoints return only required fields.

## 5. Add Database Indexing [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.4
### Description: Create and optimize indexes on frequently queried database columns to speed up data retrieval.
### Details:
Identify high-traffic queries, analyze execution plans, and add or adjust indexes accordingly. Monitor for index bloat and maintain regular index health checks.

## 6. Implement Lazy Loading [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1, 20.2
### Description: Defer loading of non-critical resources (e.g., images, components) until they are needed to reduce initial page load time.
### Details:
Apply lazy loading to below-the-fold images, offscreen components, and third-party scripts. Test for smooth user experience and fallback compatibility.

## 7. Integrate Virtualized Lists [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Use virtualization techniques to render only visible list items, improving performance for large data sets.
### Details:
Replace standard list rendering with a virtualization library (e.g., react-window, react-virtualized). Ensure smooth scrolling and correct item measurement.

## 8. Implement Prefetching and Debouncing [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1, 20.4
### Description: Prefetch likely-needed resources and debounce user-triggered actions to reduce perceived latency and unnecessary processing.
### Details:
Set up route and data prefetching for anticipated navigation. Apply debouncing to search, input, and API-triggered actions. Validate with user interaction tests.
