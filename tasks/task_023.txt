# Task ID: 23
# Title: Internationalization and Localization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement internationalization support for multiple languages, including RTL languages, and localization of date/time formats and number formatting.
# Details:
1. Install and configure next-intl (v3.0+)
2. Create translation files for supported languages
3. Implement language selector component
4. Add RTL support for appropriate languages
5. Create locale-specific number formatting
6. Implement date/time localization
7. Add translatable UI strings extraction
8. Create dynamic font loading for different scripts
9. Implement cultural considerations in design
10. Add language preference persistence
11. Create fallback mechanisms for missing translations
12. Implement automatic language detection

# Test Strategy:
Test UI rendering in multiple languages, verify RTL layout works correctly, ensure date/time formats display correctly for different locales, validate number formatting follows local conventions, and test language switching functionality.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up next-intl and Project Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install next-intl, configure Next.js for i18n routing, and establish the required directory structure for locale-based routing and message files.
### Details:
Run 'npm install next-intl'. Update next.config.js to include i18n locales and defaultLocale. Create the [locale] dynamic segment in the app directory. Set up the messages or locales directory with language-specific JSON files for translations. Ensure next-intl plugin is integrated in next.config.js.

## 2. Create and Manage Translation Files [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1
### Description: Develop and organize translation JSON files for each supported language, ensuring all UI strings are covered and structured for scalability.
### Details:
For each supported language, create a JSON file (e.g., en.json, fr.json) in the messages or locales directory. Populate these files with key-value pairs for all translatable UI strings. Establish a process for updating and maintaining these files as the app evolves.

## 3. Implement Language Selector and Locale Switching [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1, 23.2
### Description: Develop a UI component for users to select their preferred language, and ensure the app updates content and routing accordingly.
### Details:
Build a language selector component accessible from the main navigation. On selection, update the locale in the URL and reload content in the chosen language. Ensure locale switching is seamless and persists across navigation.

## 4. Support RTL Languages and Cultural Design Adjustments [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.2
### Description: Enable right-to-left (RTL) layout support for applicable languages and adjust UI components for cultural appropriateness.
### Details:
Detect RTL languages (e.g., Arabic, Hebrew) and apply 'dir="rtl"' to the HTML root or relevant containers. Adjust CSS and layout components to ensure proper alignment and mirroring. Review icons, images, and design elements for cultural relevance and appropriateness.

## 5. Implement Number, Date, and String Formatting [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.2
### Description: Ensure all numbers, dates, and formatted strings are localized according to the active locale using next-intl utilities.
### Details:
Replace hardcoded date, time, and number formats with next-intl formatting functions. Audit the app for all instances of formatted output and update them to use locale-aware formatting. Test formatting for all supported locales.

## 6. Enable Locale Preference Persistence, Fallbacks, and Auto-Detection [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.3
### Description: Persist user language preference, implement locale fallbacks, and auto-detect preferred language on first visit.
### Details:
Store selected locale in cookies or localStorage for persistence. Implement logic to fall back to a default locale if a translation is missing. Use middleware to auto-detect browser language on first visit and redirect or set locale accordingly.
