# Test Strategy:
Test analytics calculations for accuracy, verify chart rendering with various data sets, ensure filtering works correctly, validate export functionality produces correct data, and test responsive behavior of charts on different screen sizes.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Dashboard Overview Page [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a clean, minimalist overview page that follows the 5-second rule for immediate comprehension
### Details:
Design a logical layout using the inverted pyramid principle, placing the most important metrics at the top. Limit to 2-3 key visualizations that provide immediate insights into overall performance. Include clear section labels and use consistent color coding to define different areas.

## 2. Implement Grade Distribution Visualization [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Develop interactive charts showing grade distribution across different parameters
### Details:
Create visualizations (bar charts, histograms) that display grade distributions. Include filtering options by time period, subject, and student groups. Ensure the visualization follows dashboard design principles with clear labels and a logical layout that helps users quickly understand grade patterns.

## 3. Build Difficulty Analysis Component [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Create a component that analyzes and visualizes question/topic difficulty levels
### Details:
Develop algorithms to calculate difficulty metrics based on success rates, time spent, and retry attempts. Design visualizations that highlight the most challenging topics or questions. Include comparative views to show difficulty trends over time and across different student segments.

## 4. Develop Mistake Pattern Analysis [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1, 14.3
### Description: Create visualizations that identify and display common mistake patterns
### Details:
Implement data processing to identify recurring mistake patterns across assessments. Design visualizations that categorize and display these patterns with frequency metrics. Include drill-down capabilities to see specific examples of each mistake type and related learning resources.

## 5. Implement Performance Trends Module [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Develop time-series visualizations showing performance trends over selected periods
### Details:
Create line charts and trend indicators that display performance metrics over time. Include options for different time intervals (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly). Add benchmark lines and goal tracking to provide context for the performance data.

## 6. Build Comparative Analysis Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2, 14.5
### Description: Create tools for comparing performance across different dimensions
### Details:
Develop side-by-side comparison views for different time periods, student groups, or subjects. Include statistical significance indicators for meaningful comparisons. Design visualizations that highlight gaps and improvements between compared entities.

## 7. Implement Dashboard Navigation System [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Create an intuitive navigation system for moving between dashboard sections
### Details:
Design a tab-based or sidebar navigation that clearly indicates current location. Implement breadcrumbs for deep navigation paths. Ensure navigation elements are consistent across all dashboard sections and follow established UX patterns for analytics interfaces.

## 8. Develop Advanced Filtering Capabilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1, 14.2, 14.3, 14.4, 14.5, 14.6
### Description: Create comprehensive filtering options that work across all dashboard components
### Details:
Implement global and section-specific filters for time periods, subjects, difficulty levels, and user groups. Design an intuitive filter interface with clear visual indicators of active filters. Include preset filter combinations for common analysis scenarios and allow users to save custom filter sets.

## 9. Implement Data Export Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2, 14.3, 14.4, 14.5, 14.6
### Description: Create options for exporting dashboard data in multiple formats
### Details:
Develop export capabilities for raw data (CSV, Excel) and visualizations (PNG, PDF). Include options to export entire dashboard views or specific components. Implement scheduling for automated exports and delivery via email or to cloud storage locations.

## 10. Create Responsive Design Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1, 14.7
### Description: Ensure dashboard functions properly across all device sizes with appropriate layouts
### Details:
Implement responsive design principles that adapt the dashboard layout to different screen sizes. Create specific optimized views for mobile devices that prioritize the most important metrics. Test and optimize performance across various devices to ensure smooth interaction regardless of platform.
