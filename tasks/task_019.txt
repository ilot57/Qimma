# Task ID: 19
# Title: Error Handling and Edge Cases
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11, 12, 18
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive error handling for various edge cases, including large file uploads, AI processing failures, and illegible handwriting scenarios.
# Details:
1. Create error boundary components for UI
2. Implement specific error messages for different scenarios
3. Add retry mechanisms for failed operations
4. Create fallback options for AI processing failures
5. Implement manual override capabilities
6. Add support contact information display
7. Create error logging with Sentry integration
8. Implement error notification system
9. Add handling for illegible handwriting with manual transcription option
10. Create skip question functionality for problematic cases
11. Implement confidence score display for AI processing
12. Add detailed error reporting for debugging

# Test Strategy:
Test error handling with various failure scenarios, verify retry mechanisms work correctly, ensure fallback options provide usable alternatives, validate manual override capabilities work as expected, and test the system with deliberately problematic inputs.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Error Boundaries in UI [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop error boundary components to catch and display errors in the UI without crashing the entire application.
### Details:
Ensure error boundaries are placed at strategic points in the component tree to isolate failures and provide fallback UI.

## 2. Design Scenario-Specific Error Messages [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1
### Description: Create and map clear, actionable error messages for different error scenarios across UI, backend, and AI flows.
### Details:
Work with UX to ensure messages are user-friendly and provide guidance for next steps.

## 3. Develop Retry Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.2
### Description: Implement retry logic for recoverable errors, allowing users or the system to attempt failed operations again.
### Details:
Use Try-Catch-Finally blocks and configurable retry limits; ensure retries do not affect unrelated transactions.

## 4. Integrate AI Fallbacks [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.3
### Description: Provide alternative AI models or workflows when primary AI inference fails or returns low confidence.
### Details:
Define fallback strategies and ensure seamless transition between primary and fallback AI paths.

## 5. Enable Manual Override and Skip Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.4
### Description: Allow users to manually override AI or system decisions and skip problematic steps or data entries.
### Details:
Ensure overrides and skips are logged and do not block overall workflow progress.

## 6. Display Support Information and Reporting Options [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.5
### Description: Provide users with support contact info and a mechanism to report persistent or unhandled errors.
### Details:
Integrate support links and error reporting forms into error UI components.

## 7. Implement Logging and Notification Systems [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Log all errors and exceptions with relevant context and trigger notifications for critical failures.
### Details:
Ensure logs capture error codes, stack traces, user actions, and system state; set up alerting for high-severity issues.

## 8. Handle Illegible Handwriting and Confidence Scores [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Detect and flag illegible handwriting or low-confidence AI outputs, prompting user review or alternative actions.
### Details:
Display confidence scores, highlight uncertain data, and provide options to accept, correct, or skip entries.
