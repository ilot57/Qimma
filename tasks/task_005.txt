# Details:
1. Create responsive dashboard layout with fixed header and collapsible sidebar (240px expanded)
2. Implement exam list view with sorting and pagination
3. Add comprehensive filtering system by status, subject, and date
4. Create real-time status update indicators
5. Implement quick access section for recent exams
6. Add performance metrics overview cards
7. Display credit balance prominently
8. Create collapsible sidebar navigation with all required sections
9. Add user profile quick access in header
10. Implement responsive design for mobile and tablet
11. Add skeleton loading states for better UX
12. Create empty states for new users

# Test Strategy:
Test dashboard loading performance, verify all filters work correctly, ensure responsive behavior on different screen sizes, validate navigation paths work as expected, and test real-time updates of exam status.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Dashboard Layout Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the overall layout framework for the dashboard including grid system, component placement, and responsive breakpoints
### Details:
Design the dashboard's main container, grid system, and spacing guidelines. Include specifications for header, main content area, sidebar, and footer. Create wireframes showing component placement at different screen sizes. Define the responsive behavior for all layout elements.

Dashboard layout improvements completed:

- Sidebar width optimization: Reduced from w-64 to w-56 (expanded) and w-16 to w-14 (collapsed) to align with 8px grid system
- Implemented contextual Lucide icons (BookOpen, CheckCircle, Clock, Coins, TrendingUp, FileText) replacing generic colored circles
- Integrated Plus Jakarta Sans font family for a modern, professional typography system
- Transitioned from blue to emerald/teal color palette for a warmer, contemporary appearance
- Enhanced design consistency with standardized rounded corners (rounded-xl), proper spacing, subtle shadows, and organized Tailwind class ordering
- Improved visual hierarchy and readability through thoughtful component arrangement and spacing

All implementations adhere to core design principles: clarity, efficiency, accessibility, responsiveness, and consistency.

## 2. Implement Exam List Component [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Develop the exam list component with sorting, pagination, and item display
### Details:
Create the exam list table/grid with columns for exam name, date, status, and score. Implement sorting functionality for each column. Add pagination controls with configurable items per page. Design individual exam item cards with appropriate visual indicators for status. Include empty state design for when no exams are available.

## 3. Build Advanced Filtering System [cancelled]
### Dependencies: 5.2, 27
### Description: Create a comprehensive filtering system for the exam list with multiple filter types and saved filters
### Details:
Implement filter controls for date ranges, exam types, status, and scores. Create UI for filter selection, application, and clearing. Add functionality for saving and loading custom filter combinations. Ensure filters work with pagination and sorting. Design mobile-friendly filter UI that collapses appropriately.

The advanced filtering system will be implemented on the dedicated /dashboard/exams page (Task 27) rather than the main dashboard. The main dashboard will retain a simplified exam list for overview purposes only. The comprehensive filtering functionality (date ranges, exam types, status, scores), custom filter combinations, and related features will be built into the dedicated exams page. This separation allows the dashboard to focus on providing a high-level overview while the exams page handles detailed exam management and advanced filtering capabilities. Ensure the UI designs and implementations reflect this architectural change.
