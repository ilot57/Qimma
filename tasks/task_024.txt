# Task ID: 24
# Title: Analytics and Monitoring Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 19
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate analytics and monitoring tools including Mixpanel for user analytics and Sentry for error tracking and performance monitoring.
# Details:
1. Install and configure Mixpanel SDK
2. Implement event tracking for key user actions
3. Create custom user properties for segmentation
4. Add conversion funnel tracking
5. Implement retention analysis
6. Create dashboard for key metrics
7. Install and configure Sentry for error tracking
8. Add performance monitoring
9. Implement breadcrumbs for error context
10. Create alert system for critical issues
11. Add user feedback collection on errors
12. Implement privacy-compliant analytics

# Test Strategy:
Verify event tracking captures all key user actions, ensure error tracking provides sufficient context for debugging, validate performance monitoring accurately measures key metrics, test alert system for critical issues, and verify privacy compliance of analytics implementation.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Install and Configure Mixpanel SDK [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate the Mixpanel SDK into both frontend and backend codebases, ensuring correct initialization with the project token and required permissions.
### Details:
Follow platform-specific installation guides (e.g., npm, CocoaPods, Gradle). Verify SDK loads and sends test events. Ensure permissions (e.g., INTERNET, ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE) are set as needed.

## 2. Develop and Document a Tracking Plan [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Create a centralized tracking plan that defines key business goals, KPIs, user flows, events, event properties, and user profile properties.
### Details:
Collaborate with stakeholders to identify critical metrics. Map KPIs to user flows, then translate flows into events and properties. Document in a shared, version-controlled format.

## 3. Implement Event Tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.2
### Description: Instrument the application to send events to Mixpanel according to the tracking plan, including all required event properties.
### Details:
Add event tracking code at key user interaction points. Ensure event names and properties match the tracking plan. Test event delivery in Mixpanel dashboard.

## 4. Set Up User Properties and Profiles [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.3
### Description: Configure user identification and profile updates in Mixpanel to enable user-level analytics and segmentation.
### Details:
Implement user identification (distinct_id) and set user properties (e.g., plan, signup date). Ensure updates occur at login, registration, and profile changes.

## 5. Configure Funnel and Retention Analysis [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.4
### Description: Set up funnel and retention reports in Mixpanel to analyze user journeys and cohort retention based on tracked events.
### Details:
Define funnels for key flows (e.g., signup to purchase). Create retention cohorts and analyze drop-off points. Share insights with stakeholders.

## 6. Build Analytics Dashboards [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.5
### Description: Create Mixpanel dashboards to visualize key metrics, funnels, and retention data for ongoing monitoring.
### Details:
Design dashboards for product, marketing, and leadership teams. Include charts for KPIs, conversion rates, and retention. Set up dashboard sharing and permissions.

## 7. Integrate Sentry for Error and Performance Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Set up Sentry SDK for error tracking, performance monitoring, breadcrumbs, and alerting in both frontend and backend.
### Details:
Install Sentry SDK, configure DSN, and enable automatic error and performance tracking. Implement breadcrumbs for key actions. Set up alert rules for critical errors.

## 8. Implement Feedback Collection and Privacy Compliance [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.6, 24.7
### Description: Add user feedback collection mechanisms and ensure analytics/monitoring implementations comply with privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
### Details:
Integrate feedback widgets or forms. Review data collection practices, update privacy policy, and implement consent management for analytics and monitoring tools.
