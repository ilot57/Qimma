# Task ID: 21
# Title: Security Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 18
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive security measures including HTTPS enforcement, API rate limiting, input sanitization, and data encryption.
# Details:
1. Configure HTTPS enforcement
2. Implement API rate limiting
3. Add input sanitization for all user inputs
4. Create SQL injection prevention measures
5. Implement XSS protection
6. Add CSRF protection
7. Create secure headers configuration
8. Implement data encryption at rest
9. Add data encryption in transit
10. Create security audit logging
11. Implement regular security scanning
12. Add GDPR compliance measures including data export and deletion

# Test Strategy:
Perform security testing including penetration testing, verify rate limiting prevents abuse, ensure input sanitization blocks malicious inputs, validate encryption works correctly for sensitive data, and test GDPR compliance features.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement HTTPS Across All Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure the web server to enforce HTTPS for all routes, redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS, and ensure valid SSL/TLS certificates are in place.
### Details:
Verify certificate validity, enforce HSTS, and test for downgrade attacks.

## 2. Set Up Rate Limiting [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate rate limiting middleware or API gateway rules to restrict the number of requests per user/IP within a defined time window.
### Details:
Define thresholds, handle rate limit violations gracefully, and test for bypass attempts.

## 3. Sanitize and Validate User Input [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement input validation and sanitization on both frontend and backend to prevent injection and XSS attacks.
### Details:
Use allowlists, reject unexpected input, and leverage framework-specific validation libraries.

## 4. Prevent SQL Injection [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.3
### Description: Refactor all database queries to use parameterized statements or ORM methods, avoiding direct string concatenation with user input.
### Details:
Audit all data access code, add automated tests for injection attempts, and review legacy code.

## 5. Implement XSS and CSRF Protections [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.3
### Description: Deploy output encoding, CSP headers, and CSRF tokens to mitigate cross-site scripting and request forgery risks.
### Details:
Test with automated scanners and manual payloads to verify effectiveness.

## 6. Configure Secure HTTP Headers [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.1, 21.5
### Description: Set security headers such as Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, and Referrer-Policy.
### Details:
Review header settings for all endpoints and verify with security scanning tools.

## 7. Encrypt Sensitive Data at Rest [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Apply encryption to databases, file storage, and backups containing sensitive or personal data.
### Details:
Use strong encryption algorithms, manage keys securely, and document encryption coverage.

## 8. Encrypt Data in Transit [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.1
### Description: Ensure all internal and external data transfers use secure protocols (TLS 1.2+), including API calls and inter-service communication.
### Details:
Audit all network paths, update legacy protocols, and test with packet sniffing tools.

## 9. Implement Audit Logging [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up comprehensive logging for authentication events, data access, administrative actions, and security-relevant events.
### Details:
Ensure logs are tamper-resistant, timestamped, and regularly reviewed.

## 10. Integrate Security Scanning and Penetration Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.4, 21.5, 21.6, 21.7, 21.8, 21.9
### Description: Schedule regular automated vulnerability scans and manual penetration tests to identify and remediate security flaws.
### Details:
Document findings, track remediation, and retest after fixes.

## 11. Ensure GDPR Compliance [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.7, 21.9
### Description: Review data collection, processing, and storage practices to align with GDPR requirements, including consent, data minimization, and user rights.
### Details:
Update privacy policy, implement data subject request workflows, and conduct a DPIA if necessary.

## 12. Implement Data Export and Deletion Features [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop user-facing tools to export personal data and permanently delete user accounts and associated data upon request.
### Details:
Ensure export is in a standard format, deletion is irreversible, and actions are logged for audit purposes.
