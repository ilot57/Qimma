# Task ID: 25
# Title: Deployment and CI/CD Pipeline
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the deployment infrastructure on AWS Amplify with CloudFront CDN, and implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
# Details:
1. Configure AWS Amplify for hosting
2. Set up CloudFront CDN
3. Configure Route 53 for domain management
4. Implement AWS Certificate Manager for SSL
5. Create separate environments (Development, Staging, Production)
6. Set up CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
7. Implement automated testing in pipeline
8. Create build optimization for production
9. Add environment-specific configuration
10. Implement blue-green deployment strategy
11. Create rollback mechanisms
12. Add deployment notifications
13. Implement performance monitoring post-deployment

# Test Strategy:
Test complete deployment process to all environments, verify SSL configuration works correctly, ensure CDN properly caches static assets, validate automated tests run in CI/CD pipeline, and test rollback mechanisms for failed deployments.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up AWS Amplify project [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize and configure the AWS Amplify project for the application
### Details:
Create a new Amplify project, configure the necessary environment settings, and set up the project structure according to best practices. This includes installing the Amplify CLI and initializing the project with appropriate configurations.

## 2. Connect Git repository to Amplify [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1
### Description: Link the application's Git repository to AWS Amplify for CI/CD
### Details:
Connect the application's Git repository (GitHub, CodeCommit, etc.) to AWS Amplify. Configure branch settings and permissions to enable automated deployments on code commits.

## 3. Configure environment variables and backend settings [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1
### Description: Set up environment-specific configurations for different deployment stages
### Details:
Create and configure environment variables for development, staging, and production environments. Set up backend resources and ensure proper configuration for each environment. Implement secure storage of sensitive information.

## 4. Implement automated testing in CI pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.2
### Description: Set up automated testing to run during the CI process
### Details:
Configure unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to run automatically during the CI process. Ensure tests are properly integrated with the build pipeline and set up failure conditions that prevent deployment of broken code.

## 5. Configure CloudFront distribution [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1
### Description: Set up and optimize CloudFront for content delivery
### Details:
Configure CloudFront distribution for the application, including cache behaviors, origin settings, and geographic restrictions. Optimize for performance and implement proper cache invalidation strategies.

## 6. Set up custom domain and SSL with Route 53 [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.5
### Description: Configure custom domain and SSL certificates for secure access
### Details:
Register or configure custom domain in Route 53, set up DNS records, and implement SSL certificates through AWS Certificate Manager. Ensure proper HTTPS configuration and redirect HTTP to HTTPS.

## 7. Implement blue-green deployment strategy [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.2, 25.3
### Description: Configure blue-green deployment for zero-downtime updates
### Details:
Set up blue-green deployment configuration in Amplify to enable zero-downtime deployments. Configure traffic shifting rules and validation tests to ensure smooth transitions between environments.

## 8. Create automated rollback mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.7
### Description: Implement automated rollback procedures for failed deployments
### Details:
Configure automated rollback triggers based on deployment health checks, error rates, or other metrics. Implement scripts and procedures to restore the previous stable version in case of deployment failures.

## 9. Set up deployment notifications [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.2
### Description: Configure notification systems for deployment events
### Details:
Implement notification systems using AWS SNS, Slack integrations, or email alerts to notify team members about deployment status, successes, and failures. Configure different notification levels based on severity.

## 10. Implement post-deployment monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.8, 25.9
### Description: Set up monitoring and alerting for the deployed application
### Details:
Configure CloudWatch metrics, logs, and alarms to monitor application performance and health. Set up dashboards for key metrics and implement alerting for critical issues. Integrate with existing monitoring tools if applicable.
