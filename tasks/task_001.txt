### Description: Create a new Next.js 14+ project using create-next-app, enabling TypeScript, App Router, and src directory structure.
### Details:
Run `npx create-next-app@latest` and select options for TypeScript, App Router, and src directory. Verify project structure and initial run.

## 2. Configure Tailwind CSS [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Set up Tailwind CSS in the Next.js project, including configuration files and initial styles.

## 4. Set Up ESLint for Code Quality [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Configure ESLint with recommended rules for Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
### Details:
Install ESLint, extend with Next.js and TypeScript plugins, and add Tailwind CSS linting rules. Ensure linting works on sample files.

## 5. Configure Prettier for Code Formatting [done]
### Dependencies: 1.4
### Description: Install and set up Prettier, ensuring compatibility with ESLint and project conventions.
### Details:
Install Prettier and related plugins, create .prettierrc, and configure ESLint-Prettier integration. Test formatting on sample files.
<info added on 2025-05-29T19:08:32.609Z>
Prettier configuration has been successfully implemented with the following components:

- Installed Prettier with ESLint integration packages (eslint-config-prettier, eslint-plugin-prettier)
- Added Tailwind CSS plugin (prettier-plugin-tailwindcss) for proper class formatting
- Implemented import sorting plugin (@trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports)
- Created .prettierrc with comprehensive configuration:
  - Consistent formatting rules (semi: true, singleQuote: true, tabWidth: 2)
  - Import ordering hierarchy (React → Next.js → Third-party → Local imports)
  - Tailwind class sorting enabled
- Created .prettierignore file to exclude build artifacts and config files
- Updated ESLint configuration for seamless Prettier integration
- Verified package.json scripts functionality:
  - `npm run format` - Format all files
  - `npm run format:check` - Check formatting
  - `npm run lint` - ESLint + Prettier validation

Verification confirmed 24 files were successfully formatted, ESLint and Prettier integration works without conflicts, and the build process completes successfully. The development environment now has consistent code formatting standards in place.

## 6. Initialize Git Repository and Define Branching Strategy [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Initialize a Git repository, create .gitignore, and document the branching strategy (e.g., main, develop, feature branches).
### Details:
Run `git init`, add .gitignore, make initial commit, and create documentation for branching workflow in README or CONTRIBUTING.md.

## 7. Create Environment Configuration Files [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Set up .env files for different environments (development, production, test) and document environment variable usage.
### Details:
Create .env.local, .env.production, and .env.example. Add sample variables and update documentation for environment management.
<info added on 2025-05-29T19:14:02.337Z>
Environment configuration files have been successfully created and set up. Created a comprehensive `.env.example` file containing all required environment variables including authentication (Clerk), database (Supabase), payments (Stripe), AI processing (OpenAI), file storage (AWS S3), email (Resend), analytics, performance, security, and feature flags. Created `.env.local` for local development based on the example template. Developed detailed documentation in `scripts/environment-setup.md` explaining the environment setup process. Verified that all environment files are properly git-ignored as configured in .gitignore. Confirmed that Next.js correctly detects the environment files through successful build testing. The environment configuration is now ready to support authentication setup, database connection, payment processing, AI integration, and all subsequent development tasks.

## 8. Set Up Husky for Git Hooks [done]
### Dependencies: 1.6, 1.5
### Description: Install and configure Husky to enforce pre-commit and pre-push hooks for linting and formatting.
### Details:
Install Husky, add hooks to run ESLint and Prettier before commits, and verify hooks trigger as expected.
<info added on 2025-05-29T19:17:38.455Z>
**Implementation Summary:**
- Installed Husky v9.1.7 and lint-staged v16.1.0
- Initialized Husky with `npx husky init`
- Created pre-commit hook to run lint-staged on staged files
- Configured lint-staged in package.json to:
  - Run ESLint --fix and Prettier --write on *.{ts,tsx,js,jsx} files
  - Run Prettier --write on *.{json,css,md} files
- Added "prepare": "husky" script for automatic installation
- Updated pre-commit hook to remove deprecated husky.sh lines for v10 compatibility
- Created commit-msg hook for conventional commit enforcement
- Successfully tested pre-commit hook with real commit

**Verification Results:**
- Commit process worked with pre-commit validation
- Lint-staged processed files successfully (backup created, tasks ran, modifications applied)
- Git hooks are properly executable and functional
- Code quality enforcement now active for all commits

**Git Hooks Configured:**
- **Pre-commit**: Runs ESLint --fix and Prettier --write on staged files
- **Commit-msg**: Enforces conventional commit format (ready for commitlint)

**Benefits Achieved:**
- Code quality enforcement - No more unformatted or linted code in commits
- Consistent style - All committed code follows project standards
- Fast feedback - Issues caught before commit, not in CI
- Team alignment - Same standards enforced for all developers

**Ready For:**
- Team development with consistent code quality
- CI/CD pipeline integration  
- Automated code formatting and linting
