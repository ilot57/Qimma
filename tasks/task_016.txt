# Task ID: 16
# Title: Bulk Editing and Modification Tools
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 15
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement bulk editing capabilities for grades, feedback, and marking scheme updates across multiple student submissions.
# Details:
1. Create bulk grade adjustment interface
2. Implement marking scheme update functionality
3. Add bulk feedback editing capability
4. Create alternative answer addition interface
5. Implement regrade functionality after scheme changes
6. Add confirmation dialogs for bulk actions
7. Create undo functionality for bulk changes
8. Implement change tracking for bulk edits
9. Add filtering for selecting papers to edit
10. Create batch processing for bulk changes
11. Implement progress tracking for bulk operations
12. Add error handling for failed bulk operations

# Test Strategy:
Test bulk grade adjustments with various selection criteria, verify marking scheme updates correctly regrade papers, ensure bulk feedback editing applies to all selected papers, validate undo functionality restores previous state, and test the system with large numbers of papers.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Bulk Grade Adjustment UI [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a user interface for bulk editing of grades with intuitive controls and clear visual feedback
### Details:
Design a modal interface similar to the Teamwork bulk editing model that allows users to select multiple student submissions and apply grade changes. Include options for absolute and relative grade adjustments, preview of changes, and confirmation steps. Consider accessibility requirements and responsive design for different screen sizes.

## 2. Implement Marking Scheme Update Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Develop functionality to update marking schemes across multiple submissions simultaneously
### Details:
Create a system that allows instructors to modify marking criteria, point values, or rubric elements across multiple student submissions. Include validation to ensure marking scheme integrity, options to preview changes before applying, and the ability to selectively apply changes to specific criteria only.

## 3. Develop Bulk Feedback System [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Create a mechanism for adding, editing, or removing feedback across multiple submissions
### Details:
Implement a text editor with templates and macros for common feedback. Allow instructors to append, prepend, replace, or conditionally add feedback based on grade thresholds or specific criteria. Include support for rich text formatting, media embedding, and comment categorization (e.g., positive feedback, areas for improvement).

## 4. Build Alternative Answers Recognition System [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.2
### Description: Develop a system to recognize and credit alternative correct answers across multiple submissions
### Details:
Create functionality that allows instructors to define new acceptable answers and automatically apply credit to all matching submissions. Include pattern matching capabilities, similarity thresholds, and options to review borderline cases. Implement a verification step to confirm which submissions will be affected before applying changes.

## 5. Implement Regrade Logic and Transactional Safety [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1, 16.2, 16.3, 16.4
### Description: Develop secure transaction handling for bulk grade changes with rollback capabilities
### Details:
Create a robust transaction system that ensures all bulk operations either complete fully or roll back completely. Implement database locking mechanisms to prevent conflicts during bulk operations. Design an audit log that records all changes, who made them, when, and why. Include performance optimizations for handling large batches of submissions.

## 6. Create Confirmation Workflows and Undo Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.5
### Description: Develop confirmation dialogs and undo capabilities for bulk operations
### Details:
Design a multi-step confirmation process that clearly communicates the scope and impact of bulk changes. Implement time-limited undo functionality that allows reverting bulk operations within a configurable window. Create detailed change summaries that show before/after states and affected student counts.

## 7. Implement Filtering and Batch Processing [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1, 16.5
### Description: Create advanced filtering options and batch processing capabilities for targeted bulk operations
### Details:
Develop a comprehensive filtering system that allows instructors to target specific subsets of submissions based on multiple criteria (e.g., score ranges, submission dates, specific answers). Implement batch processing with progress indicators for large operations. Include scheduling options for running bulk operations during off-peak hours.

## 8. Develop Error Handling and Progress Tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.5, 16.6, 16.7
### Description: Create robust error handling and progress tracking for bulk operations
### Details:
Implement comprehensive error detection, reporting, and recovery mechanisms for bulk operations. Design a progress tracking interface that shows real-time updates during processing. Create detailed error logs with actionable information for resolving issues. Include notification systems to alert users when long-running operations complete or encounter problems.
