# Task ID: 13
# Title: Real-time Processing Status Updates
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement real-time status updates for exam processing using WebSockets or polling to keep users informed of progress.
# Details:
1. Implement polling mechanism for processing status updates
2. Create processing status UI components
3. Add estimated completion time calculation
4. Implement progress bar for overall processing
5. Create individual paper processing status indicators
6. Add real-time error notifications
7. Implement completion notifications
8. Create email notification system using Resend
9. Add browser notifications for completion
10. Implement partial results access during processing
11. Create processing log viewer
12. Add retry functionality for failed papers

# Test Strategy:
Test real-time updates with various processing durations, verify estimated completion time accuracy, ensure notifications are delivered correctly, validate partial results access works as expected, and test the system with network interruptions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Real-Time Backend Infrastructure (Polling/WebSocket) [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up backend endpoints and logic to support both polling and WebSocket connections for real-time status updates.
### Details:
Develop REST API endpoints for polling and configure WebSocket server (e.g., using socket.io or native WebSocket) to broadcast status changes. Ensure scalability and reliability for concurrent connections.

## 2. Develop Frontend Real-Time Data Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Create frontend logic to connect to backend via polling and WebSocket, handle incoming status updates, and manage connection lifecycle.
### Details:
Implement setInterval-based polling and WebSocket client logic. Handle reconnection, error states, and fallback between polling and WebSocket as needed.

## 3. Design and Build Status UI Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.2
### Description: Develop UI components to display real-time status updates, including overall status, progress, and individual indicators.
### Details:
Create modular React/Vue components for status display, ensuring accessibility and responsiveness. Integrate with real-time data handlers.

## 4. Implement Estimated Time Calculation Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1, 13.3
### Description: Develop backend and frontend logic to calculate and display estimated time remaining for ongoing processes.
### Details:
Use historical data or progress metrics to estimate time remaining. Display estimates in the UI and update them in real time.

## 5. Create Progress Bars and Individual Status Indicators [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.3, 13.4
### Description: Build visual progress bars and per-task indicators reflecting real-time progress and status.
### Details:
Implement animated progress bars and icons for each tracked item. Ensure updates are smooth and reflect backend state accurately.

## 6. Integrate Notification Systems (Email/Browser) [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1, 13.3
### Description: Set up backend and frontend logic to send notifications via email and browser when status changes or completes.
### Details:
Configure email service (e.g., SMTP, SendGrid) and browser notification APIs. Allow users to opt-in/out and customize notification preferences.

## 7. Display Partial Results and Log Viewer [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.3, 13.5
### Description: Enable UI to show partial results as they become available and provide a real-time log viewer for process output.
### Details:
Stream partial results and logs from backend to frontend. Implement a scrollable, filterable log viewer component.

## 8. Add Retry Functionality for Failed Updates [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.2, 13.3
### Description: Implement logic to detect failed status updates and allow users to retry operations or re-establish connections.
### Details:
Provide UI controls for retrying failed tasks or reconnecting to the server. Handle retries gracefully and update status accordingly.
