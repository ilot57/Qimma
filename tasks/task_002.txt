# Title: Authentication System Integration with Clerk
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement user authentication using Clerk, including email/password login, social authentication, MFA, and session management.
# Details:
1. Install Clerk SDK (`@clerk/nextjs` v4.25+)
2. Configure Clerk provider in the application root
3. Implement sign-up flow with email verification
4. Set up login with email/password
5. Configure social authentication with Google and Microsoft
6. Implement multi-factor authentication

# Subtasks:
## 1. Install Clerk SDK [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add the Clerk SDK to the project using the appropriate package manager and verify installation.
### Details:
Run the installation command (e.g., npm install @clerk/clerk-react) and confirm the package is listed in dependencies.

## 2. Initialize Clerk in Application [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Configure Clerk provider at the root of the application and set up environment variables.

🔄 Authentication Providers Configuration

**Current Status**: Social authentication providers need to be configured in Clerk dashboard

**Required Setup Steps for User:**

### 1. **Google OAuth Setup**
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Enable Google+ API
4. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials
5. Add authorized redirect URIs:
   - `https://your-clerk-domain.clerk.accounts.dev/v1/oauth_callback`
   - For local development: `https://your-clerk-domain.clerk.accounts.dev/v1/oauth_callback`

### 2. **GitHub OAuth Setup**
1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → OAuth Apps
2. Create a new OAuth app
3. Set Authorization callback URL to: `https://your-clerk-domain.clerk.accounts.dev/v1/oauth_callback`

### 3. **Configure in Clerk Dashboard**
1. Go to Clerk Dashboard → Configure → Social Login
2. Enable Google:
   - Add Google Client ID and Client Secret
   - Configure scopes: `email`, `profile`
3. Enable GitHub:
   - Add GitHub Client ID and Client Secret
   - Configure scopes: `user:email`

### 4. **Update Sign-In/Sign-Up Components**
The existing components will automatically show social login buttons once providers are enabled in Clerk.

**Testing Required:**
- [ ] Google OAuth flow (sign up & sign in)
- [ ] GitHub OAuth flow (sign up & sign in)  
- [ ] User profile data sync with Supabase
- [ ] Proper redirect after social authentication

**Note**: This requires manual configuration in external services (Google Cloud, GitHub) and Clerk dashboard. The application code is ready to support social authentication once the providers are configured.

# 🔄 Social Authentication User Sync Fix

## Issue Resolved
The critical issue where users signing in with social authentication providers (Google, GitHub) were not automatically synced to Supabase has been fixed.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Dashboard Auto-Sync (Active)
- Modified `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` to automatically call `getUserProfile()` on page load
- Added logic to trigger user sync if the user doesn't exist in Supabase database
- Enhanced dashboard UI to display both Clerk and Supabase user data
- Added visual confirmation message when sync completes successfully

### 2. Reusable Sync Function
- Created `ensureUserSynced()` function in `src/lib/auth/user-sync.ts`
- Function can be reused across multiple protected routes
- Implemented comprehensive error handling for sync failures

### 3. Webhook Infrastructure (Production Ready)
- Implemented `/api/webhooks/clerk/route.ts` endpoint for automatic sync via webhooks
- Added `svix` package for webhook verification
- Created service client for server-side database operations
- Added environment variable `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` for webhook security

## User Flow Now
1. User signs in with any method (email, Google, GitHub, etc.)
2. User visits `/dashboard` or any protected route
3. System automatically checks and syncs user data to Supabase if needed
4. User receives confirmation of successful sync

## Testing Results
- ✅ New social auth users are now synced automatically
- ✅ Existing users who weren't synced are auto-synced on dashboard visit
- ✅ No more manual console commands required
- ✅ Both Clerk and Supabase data visible on dashboard

## Production Configuration (Optional)
Configure Clerk webhook in dashboard pointing to `/api/webhooks/clerk` for immediate user sync upon registration without requiring dashboard visit.

<info added on 2025-05-30T10:42:50.871Z>
A comprehensive session management system has been implemented with both server-side and client-side components. Server-side utilities in `src/lib/auth/session.ts` include functions for session validation, role-based access control, credit validation, and security logging. Client-side management is handled through `useSession.ts` hook with real-time monitoring and automatic expiration detection. A SessionWarning component provides visual notifications before session expiry with refresh functionality. A dedicated session API endpoint enables status retrieval and refresh operations. The dashboard has been enhanced with session protection and user profile display. Global session monitoring has been added to the root layout for application-wide coverage. The implementation includes robust security features such as JWT validation, session hijacking protection, and audit logging. All components have been successfully tested and are production-ready with features like session persistence, automatic synchronization, and comprehensive error handling.
