# Task ID: 2
# Title: Authentication System Integration with Clerk
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement user authentication using Clerk, including email/password login, social authentication, MFA, and session management.
# Details:
1. Install Clerk SDK (`@clerk/nextjs` v4.25+)
2. Configure Clerk provider in the application root
3. Implement sign-up flow with email verification
4. Set up login with email/password
5. Configure social authentication with Google and Microsoft
6. Implement multi-factor authentication
7. Set up password reset functionality
8. Configure session management with appropriate timeouts
9. Create protected routes using Clerk middleware
10. Implement user profile data synchronization with Supabase
11. Add sign-out functionality
12. Create auth-related UI components (SignIn, SignUp, UserButton)

# Test Strategy:
Test all authentication flows (signup, login, logout, password reset), verify social authentication providers work correctly, ensure protected routes redirect unauthenticated users, and validate session persistence and timeout behavior.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Install Clerk SDK [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add the Clerk SDK to the project using the appropriate package manager and verify installation.
### Details:
Run the installation command (e.g., npm install @clerk/clerk-react) and confirm the package is listed in dependencies.

## 2. Initialize Clerk in Application [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Configure Clerk provider at the root of the application and set up environment variables.
### Details:
Wrap the app with ClerkProvider, set Clerk frontend API key, and verify Clerk loads in development.
<info added on 2025-05-30T08:01:52.761Z>
Created the necessary Clerk configuration files and authentication components. Set up the ClerkProvider wrapper in the application root to provide authentication context throughout the app. Added environment variables for Clerk API keys in both the main .env file and .env.example template. Verified that Clerk initializes correctly in the development environment and authentication state is properly accessible to child components.

### Details:
Use Clerk's session hooks or backend SDK to check authentication state and handle session expiration.

## 10. Protect Application Routes [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Restrict access to protected routes based on authentication state using Clerk's utilities.
### Details:
Wrap protected routes with authentication checks and redirect unauthenticated users to login.

Successfully implemented comprehensive route protection system including:

1. **Enhanced Middleware (src/middleware.ts)**:
   - Comprehensive route matching for public, auth, protected, and API routes
   - Role-based access control for admin routes
   - Proper redirect logic with return URLs
   - API route protection with 401/403 responses

2. **Client-Side Protection Hook (src/lib/hooks/useRouteProtection.ts)**:
   - Custom hook for client-side route protection
   - Role hierarchy system (student < teacher < admin < super_admin)
   - Automatic redirects for unauthorized access
   - Loading states and authorization checks

3. **Protected Route Component (src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx)**:
   - Higher-order component for wrapping protected pages
   - Configurable role requirements
   - Loading spinner integration
   - Fallback component support

4. **API Route Protection (src/lib/auth/api-protection.ts)**:
   - Utility functions for protecting API endpoints
   - Role-based API access control
   - Consistent error responses
   - TypeScript support

5. **Example Protected Routes**:
   - User profile API (src/app/api/user/profile/route.ts) - requires authentication
   - Admin users API (src/app/api/admin/users/route.ts) - requires admin/super_admin role
   - Both routes tested and working correctly

**Testing Results**:
- ‚úÖ Unauthenticated API access properly returns 401 Unauthorized
- ‚úÖ Middleware correctly protects routes
- ‚úÖ Role-based access control implemented
- ‚úÖ Authentication flow working end-to-end

**Route Protection Coverage**:
- Public routes: /, /pricing, /about, /contact, /features
- Auth routes: /sign-in, /sign-up, /forgot-password (redirect if authenticated)
- Protected routes: /dashboard, /profile, /exams, /credits, /settings, /admin
- API routes: All protected except webhooks

The route protection system is now comprehensive and production-ready!

## 11. Synchronize Clerk with Supabase [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate Clerk authentication with Supabase backend, configure JWT templates, and update RLS policies.
