# Task ID: 22
# Title: Accessibility Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 8, 14, 15
# Priority: medium
# Description: Ensure the application meets WCAG 2.1 AA compliance standards with keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and other accessibility features.
# Details:
1. Implement keyboard navigation support
2. Add screen reader compatibility
3. Create high contrast mode option
4. Implement focus indicators
5. Add alt text for all images
6. Create ARIA labels for interactive elements
7. Implement semantic HTML structure
8. Add skip navigation links
9. Create accessible form validation
10. Implement color contrast checking
11. Add text resizing support
12. Create accessibility audit and testing process

# Test Strategy:
Test with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver), verify keyboard navigation works for all interactions, ensure color contrast meets WCAG standards, validate form error messages are accessible, and perform comprehensive accessibility audit.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Keyboard Navigation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure all interactive elements (links, buttons, form fields, menus) are accessible and operable via keyboard alone. Tab order should be logical and predictable.
### Details:
Test navigation using Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, and Space keys. Ensure no keyboard traps exist. Provide visible focus indicators for all focusable elements.

## 2. Add Screen Reader Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.1
### Description: Verify that all content and controls are accessible and understandable when using screen readers.
### Details:
Use semantic HTML, ARIA roles, and properties where necessary. Ensure dynamic content updates are announced. Test with popular screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver).

## 3. Enable High Contrast Mode and Color Contrast Compliance [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Support high contrast mode and ensure all text and UI elements meet WCAG color contrast requirements.
### Details:
Test with OS/browser high contrast settings. Use tools to verify color contrast ratios (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text). Avoid conveying information by color alone.

## 4. Provide Focus Indicators and Skip Links [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.1
### Description: Ensure visible focus indicators are present and implement skip links for bypassing repetitive navigation.
### Details:
Customize focus styles for clarity. Add skip-to-content links at the top of each page, ensuring they are visible on focus and functional with keyboard navigation.

## 5. Add Alt Text, ARIA Labels, and Semantic HTML [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure all images, icons, and interactive elements have descriptive alt text or ARIA labels. Use semantic HTML for structure.
### Details:
Write meaningful alt text for images and icons. Apply ARIA-labels to non-text controls. Use headings, lists, and landmarks appropriately for structure and navigation.

## 6. Accessible Validation, Text Resizing, and Audit/Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.2, 22.3, 22.4, 22.5
### Description: Implement accessible form validation, support text resizing up to 200%, and conduct comprehensive accessibility audits.
### Details:
Provide clear, accessible error messages and instructions. Ensure forms are usable with assistive tech. Allow text resizing without loss of content or functionality. Perform manual and automated accessibility testing using checklists and tools.
